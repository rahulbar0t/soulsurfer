Soul Surfer Is a platform designed to aid beginner surfers towards the intermediate stage in their surfing journey. As a surfer myself, it was always hard to improve my skills at home wihout being at the beach everyday. I created this tool to give technical people like myself a way to get better at surfing from an office chair. Users upload their footage and receive actionable feedback to build their knowledge of proper surf technique and guide their journey.
